# Software_Engineering_Project
Software Engineering project. I had to satisfy 3 requirements. I created 3 sequence diagrams (one for each requirement), a UML diagram and then created a maven project with database connectivity in Eclipse (Java code). I had to connect to classicmodels database [https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx] with Java code, obtain the data I needed, and then satisfy these requirements. In the end the output is displayed in Java console.

**REQUIREMENTS**

• First requirement: Report those payments greater than $100,00. 

• Second requirement: Report the products that have not been sold. 

• Third requirement: Compute the profit generated by each product line, sorted by profit 
descending. 

**SETUP:**

1)Install MYSQL

2)Start MySQL server

3)Download classicmodels database [https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx]

4)Install the Connector

5)Install Eclipse

• In order to make mvn test run on terminal, I download apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip file. In order to make them run on eclipse add jdk library.  
 
**TEST**
 
• The three requirements are checked in the following test cases. 

**Requirement1** is tested in PaymentsQueryTest.java.  
**Requirement2** is tested in ProductsNotSoldTest.java.  
**Requirement3** is tested in ProfitTest.java. 
 
**DIAGRAMS:** (250 words) 

**UML DIAGRAM:** (51 words) 

• classes from tables (Payment, Order, OrderDetails, Product)

• Connect Interface that has to do with database connection, ConnectImpl class that 
implements the previous interface and ConnectFactory that is used to return a ConnectImpl 
instance. 

• PaymentsQuery class for requirement1, ProductsNotSold class for requirement2, Profit class 
for requirement3.  Each class displays what is needed. 

**SEQUENCE DIAGRAMS:** 

**First requirement:** (51 words) 

• Classes: PaymentsQuey,  Payment, ConnectFactory, ConnectImpl. 
1. PaymentsQuery connects to the database through ConnectFactory class, 1 ResultSet is 
returned(Payment). For each row we instantiate a Payment object and store it. Then we 
close the connection(ConnectImpl). 
2. Next we store and display on console the payments  that their amount is greater than 
$100,00. 
 
**Second requirement:** (74 words) 
1. Classes: ProductsNotSold,  Product, OrderDetais, Order, ConnectFactory, ConnectImpl. 
2. We find the orders that haven’t been cancelled(Order.getStatus()!=”Cancelled”). These 
orderNumbers are stored in orderNumberOfOrdersNotCancelled list.  
3. We filter the product codes of the orders that were not cancelled, from the order details 
table, and save them in productCodeOfOrderDetailsNotCancelled list. 
4. All the productCodes are checked against productCodeOfOrderDetailsNotCancelled list and 
if productCodes not found, these products are saved in productsNotSold list. 
5. Output the productsNotSold list. 
 
**Third requirement:** (74 words) 

• Classes: Profit,  Product, OrderDetais, Order, ConnectFactory, ConnectImpl. 
1. By performing same steps 1,2 from requirement2 we end up having 
orderNumberOfOrdersNotCancelled and productCodeOfOrderDetailsNotCancelled lists 
2. For each productCode, we find the corresponding orderdetails records of the orders not 
cancelled. We then accumulate the profit generated by multiplying the quantity ordered 
with the difference of priceEach and buyPrice. That product profit is then added to the 
productLine profit. 
3. Sort and output the profit of productLines. 
 
**TEST CASES EXPLANATION:** (250 words) 

• I constructed 1  Junit test case for each requirement. I used MySQL queries to get the results 
and compare them with the results produced in my code. The order of the results may 
differ, so I sorted them before comparing them. For each test case I used a local boolean 
variable isValid, that if it’s true in the end, test case passes. isValid is true only if the results 
from MySQL query are the same with the results from my code. I didn’t used hardcoded 
string to compare the results, as new records may be added to the database in the future 
and produce different output. 
 
• **Requirement1** is tested in PaymentsQueryTest.java. I run MySQL query using Payments 
table and the results are stored in ArrayList<Payment> payments2. If the size of that arraylist 
equals the size of the arraylist produced in the code and both arraylists have the same 
contents(sorted them on checkNumber), then test case passes.

• **Requirement2** is tested in ProductsNotSoldTest.java. I run MySQL query using Orders, 
OrderDetails, Products tables and store the result in ArrayList<Product> products2. The 
result is compared with the result produced in code in the same way (sorted them on 
productCode). 
 
• **Requirement3** is tested in ProfitTest.java. I run MySQL query using Orders, OrderDetails, 
Products tables and I get 2 columns as a result. ProductLine column is stored in 
ArrayList<String> productLines, Profit column is stored in ArrayList<Double> profits. I then 
compare  the two array lists produced from MySQL query with the two  sorted arrays 
produced in code.
